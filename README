Live-chat Example
=================

This project shows you how to create a very simple real-time chat app in just JavaScript. Using AngularJS on the
frontend, express as a server, and SockJS for real-time communication.

How to install
--------------

Make sure you have node.js installed (http://nodejs.org/)
Clone the repository to an appropriate location
Open a terminal window (git bash works really well on windows)
Run `npm install`, then `bower install`
Start the server using `npm start`
Visit the chat app by going to `http://localhost:3000`

Learning points
---------------

 - Server-side Handlebars and client-side AngularJS don't combine. They use the same placeholders for data
 - There is a difference between `exports` and `module.exports`. The `chat` EventEmitter didn't work with `exports`,
   changing it to `module.exports` magically resolved the issue.
 - If you're using SockJS, it is necessary to always explicitly encode and decode your objects to/from JSON
